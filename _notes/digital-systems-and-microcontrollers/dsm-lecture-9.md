## Prime implicant
For a given cell (minterm) in a k-map, the **biggest** 'cluster' that we can
place it in is known as the **prime implicant** of that cell.  
It is possible for a cell to have multiple prime implicants, multiple clusters
to which it belongs, all of which have the same size.

When a cell belongs only to a single prime implicant, then it is known as an
**essential prime implicant** for that k-map.
